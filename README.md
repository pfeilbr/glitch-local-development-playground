# glitch-local-development-playground

Develop [Glitch](https://glitch.com) apps locally.  Based on [noise-machines/git-glitched](https://github.com/noise-machines/git-glitched).
The default Glitch development experience is to use the browser based editor.  This allows you to use your favorite local editor.
